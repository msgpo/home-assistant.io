[Proxmox VE](https://www.proxmox.com/en/) is an open-source server virtualization environment. This integration allows you to poll various data from your instance.

After configuring this component, the binary sensors automatically appear.

## Configuration

<div class='note'>
You should have at least one VM or container entry configured, else this integration won't do anything.
</div>

To use the `proxmoxve` component, add the following config to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
proxmoxve:
  - host: IP_ADDRESS
    username: USERNAME
    password: PASSWORD
    nodes:
      - node: NODE_NAME
        vms:
          - VM_ID
        containers:
          - CONTAINER_ID
```

{% configuration %}
host:
  description: IP address of the Proxmox VE instance.
  required: true
  type: string
port:
  description: The port number on which Proxmox VE is running.
  required: false
  default: 8006
  type: integer
verify_ssl:
  description: Whether to do strict validation on SSL certificates. If you use a self signed SSL certificate you need to set this to false.
  required: false
  default: true
  type: boolean
username:
  description: The username used to authenticate.
  required: true
  type: string
password:
  description: The password used to authenticate.
  required: true
  type: string
realm:
  description: The authentication realm of the user.
  required: false
  default: pam
  type: string
nodes:
  description: List of the Proxmox VE nodes to monitor.
  required: true
  type: map
  keys:
    node:
      description: Name of the node
      required: true
      type: string
    vms:
      description: List of the QEMU VMs to monitor.
      required: false
      type: list
    containers:
      description: List of the LXC containers to monitor.
      required: false
      type: list
{% endconfiguration %}

Example with multiple VMs and no containers:

```yaml
proxmoxve:
  - host: IP_ADDRESS
    username: USERNAME
    password: PASSWORD
    nodes:
      - node: NODE_NAME
        vms:
          - VM_ID_1
          - VM_ID_2
```

## Binary Sensor

The integration will automatically create a binary sensor for each tracked virtual machone or container. The binary sensor will either be on if the VM's state is running or off if the VM's state is different.

The created sensor will be called `binary_sensor.NODE_NAME_VMNAME_running`.
